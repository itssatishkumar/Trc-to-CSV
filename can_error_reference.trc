Error Warnings 
Error Warnings consist of a bit combination of error flags. The 32-bit Error Warning code is 
contained in the first 4 data bytes in Motorola format (most significant byte first). 
The following table lists the Error Warning flags that can be recorded in a Trace file: 
Code 
Short Name 
Description 
0x00000002 OVERRUN 
The CAN controller receives so many messages that not 
all of the triggered hardware interrupts can be processed 
CAN controller was read too late. 
0x00000004 BUSLIGHT 
Bus error: an error counter reached the ‘light’ limit (more 
than 0 error points). 
0x00000008 BUSHEAVY Bus error: an error counter reached the ‘heavy’ limit (at 
least 96 error points). 
0x00000010 BUSOFF 
Bus error: the CAN controller is in Bus-off state because a 
serious and continuous error exists on the bus (255 error 
points have been exceeded). 
Error Frames 
All relevant information of Error Frames is contained in the CAN ID and 4 data bytes. 
ID: Type of Error Frame 
1 = Bit Error 
2 = Form Error 
4 = Stuff Error 
8 = Other Error 
Data Byte 0: Direction 
0 = Error occurred while sending  
1 = Error occurred while receiving. 
Data Byte 1: Current Position in Bit Stream 
2 = ID.28 to ID.21 
3 = Start of frame 
4 = Bit SRTR 
5 = BIT IDE 
6 = ID.20 to ID.18 
7 = ID.17 to ID.13 
8 = CRC Sequence 
9 = Reserved Bit 0  
10 = Data field 
11 = Data Length Code 
12 = Bit RTR 
13 = Reserved Bit 1 
14 = ID.4 to ID.0 
15 = ID.12 to ID.5 
17 = Active Error Flag 
18 = Intermission 
19 = Tolerate dominant Bits 
23 = Error Delimiter 
24 = CRC Delimiter 
25 = Acknowledge Slot 
26 = End of Frame 
27 = Acknowledge Limiter 
28 = Overload Flag. 
Data Byte 2: RX Error Counter 
Current Value of the Receive Error counter. 
Data Byte 3: TX Error Counter 
Current Value of the Transmit Error counter.
